While going for "exceeds expectations" I added a few extras into my code:

In app.js I added the extra event listener to add functionality to the physical keyboard(as well as some work within the handleInteraction() method).

On line 32 of game.js I used an animation to fadeIn the "start" screen.
On line 83 of game.js I added an alert message if the player only has one heart remaining.
On lines 110 & 116 of game.js I added another fadeIn animation for the "win" and "lose" screens.

Starting on line 5 of phrase.js I created a function to create a random color, which I used later on line 33 in the addPhraseToDisplay() method.
On line 65 of phrase.js I added a fade animation for matched letters guessed correctly.
On line 66 of phrase.js I added some textShadow on recommendation of a project reviewer, for readability of the white text.
